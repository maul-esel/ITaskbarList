## ITaskbarList
### Introduction
This projects offers a library and 4 classes that enable you to use the ITaskbarList COM interface in AutoHotkey, AutoHotkey_L or AutoHotkey v2 scripts.
They were entirely written by me, maul.esel, except for SetProgressState and SetProgressValue, which were already coded by Lexikos.
