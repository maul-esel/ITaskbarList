ITaskbarList README:

This projects offers a library and 4 classes that enable you to use the ITaskbarList COM interface in AutoHotkey, AutoHotkey_L or AutoHotkey v2 scripts.
They were entirely written by me, maul.esel, except for SetProgressState and SetProgressValue, which were already coded by Lexikos.

Anyway I want to thank
	- Lexikos for AHK_L / AHK v2 including class syntax
	- Sean for his COM standard library which can be used to support AHK basic
	
Feature highlights:
	- set taskbar progress values/states
	- control the taskbar thumbnail of a window
	- delete and restore the taskbar entry of any window
	- and more...
